\item Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Complete Table \ref{table:1.2.133}.
\item  A student argues that there are 11 possible outcomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Therefore, each of them has a probability $\frac{1}{11}$. Do you agree with this argument? Justify your answer.
