\item A merchant plans to sell two types of personal computers – a desktop model and
a portable model that will cost Rs 25000 and Rs 40000 respectively. He estimates
that the total monthly demand of computers will not exceed 250 units. Determine
the number of units of each type of computers which the merchant should stock
to get maximum profit if he does not want to invest more than Rs 70 lakhs and if
his profit on the desktop model is Rs 4500 and on portable model is Rs 5000.\\
\item A diet is to contain at least 80 units of vitamin A and 100 units of minerals. Two
foods$ F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are available. Food $F_{1}$ costs Rs 4 per unit food and $F_{2}$ costs
Rs 6 per unit. One unit of food $F_{1}$ contains 3 units of vitamin A and 4 units of
minerals. One unit of food $F_{2}$ contains 6 units of vitamin A and 3 units of minerals.
Formulate this as a linear programming problem. Find the minimum cost for diet
that consists of mixture of these two foods and also meets the minimal nutritional
requirements.\\
\item There are two types of fertilisers $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$.$F_{1}$ consists of $10\%$ nitrogen and $6\%$
phosphoric acid and $F_{2}$ consists of $5\%$ nitrogen and $10\%$ phosphoric acid. After
testing the soil conditions, a farmer finds that she needs atleast 14 kg of nitrogen
and 14 kg of phosphoric acid for her crop. If $F_{1}$ costs Rs 6/kg and $F_{2}$ costs
Rs 5/kg, determine how much of each type of fertiliser should be used so that
nutrient requirements are met at a minimum cost. What is the minimum cost?\\
\item The corner points of the feasible region determined by the following system of
linear inequalities:

(A) p = q\\
(B) p = 2q\\
(C) p = 3q\\
(D) q = 3p\\

the amount of vitamin A in the diet? What is the maximum amount of vitamin A
in the diet?\\
\item A farmer mixes two brands P and Q of cattle feed. Brand P, costing Rs 250 per
bag, contains 3 units of nutritional element A, 2.5 units of element B and 2 units
of element C. Brand Q costing Rs 200 per bag contains 1.5 units of nutritional
element A, 11.25 units of element B, and 3 units of element C. The minimum
requirements of nutrients A, B and C are 18 units, 45 units and 24 units respectively.
Determine the number of bags of each brand which should be mixed in order to
produce a mixture having a minimum cost per bag? What is the minimum cost of
the mixture per bag?\\

\item An aeroplane can carry a maximum of 200 passengers. A profit of Rs 1000 is
made on each executive class ticket and a profit of Rs 600 is made on each
economy class ticket. The airline reserves at least 20 seats for executive class.
However, at least 4 times as many passengers prefer to travel by economy class
than by the executive class. Determine how many tickets of each type must be
sold in order to maximise the profit for the airline. What is the maximum profit?\\
\item An oil company has two depots A and B with capacities of 7000 L and 4000 L
