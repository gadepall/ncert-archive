%\item Angles opposite to equal sides of a triangle are equal. 
%\label{prob:tri_ang_side_eq}
%\\
%\solution Using the sine formula in \eqref{eq:tri_sin_form},%

%\end{align}
%%
%Thus, if $A=B$, $\sin A = \sin B \implies a =b$.
%\\
%\solution Use \eqref{eq:tri_sin_form} and the argument in Problem \ref{prob:tri_ang_side_eq}
